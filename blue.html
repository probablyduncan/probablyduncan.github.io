			<p>or years I struggled with the vibrant mass that is Lake Michigan. I grew up near its shores, and it became my refuge and my solace. So when I started photography, the lake, in all its grandeur, should have made a perfect subject. However, try as I did, I failed for so long to create a portrait that successfully captured all that I felt. Photos were flat, stagnant, uninteresting, and uninspired. They were too busy, seeing everything while capturing nothing.</p>
			<p>At first, I had tried to photograph the lake as landscapes. You can read all about those early photos <a href="stillwater.html">here</a>. However, as nice as these photos were, they didn't capture the lake's character. They're stark and stoic photos, but they don't encapsulate the emotions that the lake brings out of me; they don't capture what the lake means to me.</p>
			<p>I needed to distill the lake into its simplest form, make abstract what was too big to capture conventionally. Finally, in December of 2018, I cracked the code. By panning the camera while holding the shutter, I managed to create a blurred abstract of the lake's most distinctive qualities: its color and texture. I could strip away my landscapes' busy imperfections, their out-of-place waves and distracting clouds and un-curated flotsam. After the pan, only the essence of the subject is left.</p>
